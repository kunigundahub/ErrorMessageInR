The error messages indicate issues arising from security settings, package dependencies, and system configurations. Here's how to resolve them systematically:

Root Cause Analysis

1. UNC Path Issue: UNC paths (\\jumbo\userdoc\...) are not supported by CMD.EXE, which defaults to the Windows directory.


2. Dependency Conflicts: Packages such as xfun, htmltools, and bslib require newer versions than the ones available.


3. Compilation Issues: Errors like 'make' not found indicate missing build tools.

Resolution Steps

1. Switch to Local Directories

Install packages into a local directory (e.g., C:/Users/bud07888/R/win-library/4.1) instead of a UNC path. Update .libPaths():

.libPaths("C:/Users/bud07888/R/win-library/4.1")


2. Update R and Rtools

Install the latest version of R.

Ensure Rtools is installed and added to the system's PATH. For Windows, download it from Rtools.


3. Manually Update Dependencies

Install dependencies manually from source or binary:

install.packages("xfun", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("htmltools", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
install.packages("bslib", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")

For source installations, enable compilation tools (e.g., Rtools).


4. Use CRAN Mirrors

Use a reliable CRAN mirror to ensure the latest versions:

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"))


5. Force Install New Versions

Force install specific versions:

install.packages("xfun", type = "source", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")


6. Run RStudio as Administrator

If security settings block installations, run RStudio with administrative privileges.


7. Configure Proxy or Firewall

If your system blocks downloads, configure proxy settings:

Sys.setenv(http_proxy = "http://proxy_address:port")
Sys.setenv(https_proxy = "http://proxy_address:port")


8. Alternative Solutions

Use RStudio Package Manager if accessible in your environment.

Install packages offline by downloading them and using:

install.packages("path/to/package.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

Testing the Fix

After implementing these changes, try installing the rmarkdown package again:

install.packages("rmarkdown")

If issues persist, provide detailed error messages for further troubleshooting.
